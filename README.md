# Stripe Cash

This Application works but you should not use it in production.

The processes used are of questionable legality, this project was a Can I without a Should I.

So play with it in test mode but I strongly advise against using it to process funds.

## Installation

``` npm install ```

Update config/secrets-example.js to config/secrets.js
Update config/local-example.js to config/local.js

``` Sails Lift ```

You're ready to go.
