# Stripe Cash

Notes about this project:

This Application works but you should not use it in production.

The processes used are of questionable legality, this project was a Can I without a Should I.

So play with it in test mode but I strongly advise against using it to process funds.

I have also not implmented the process of sending money via email, current sending funds takes place via the rudimentary gui.

## Installation

Update config/secrets-example.js to config/secrets.js
Update config/local-example.js to config/local.js
